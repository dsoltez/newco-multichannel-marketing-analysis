# NewCo Multi-Channel Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project explores how different message styles and marketing channels impacted new customer acquisition for NewCo, a national retailer. I completed this as part of a BCG X job simulation, focusing on turning raw campaign data into actionable, business-focused insights.

# Business Objective

NewCo wanted to understand:

Which campaign message drove the most new customer revenue

Which channel performed best overall

Where they should focus marketing investment next quarter

# Dataset Used

Campaign_Data_Week1.xlsx

Supporting background materials are located in the deliverables folder.

# Tools & Skills I Used

Excel: Pivot tables, filtering, chart creation

Data Cleaning: Organizing raw campaign performance data

Customer Segmentation: Comparing new vs. existing customer behavior

Channel & Campaign Analysis: Evaluating which combinations performed strongest

Data Visualization: Communicating trends clearly through visuals

Executive Storytelling: Summarizing insights in a concise slide deck

Marketing Analytics: Understanding the impact of message style and channel choice

# Steps I Took (My Analysis Process)

Reviewed the raw dataset to understand fields and customer identifiers.

Segmented results by new vs. existing customers.

Grouped performance by channel (Email, Instagram, Web Banner).

Built pivot tables to compare revenue and customer counts.

Created visualizations (clustered column, stacked bar, pie charts).

Identified patterns in channel performance and message effectiveness.

Summarized insights and formed a recommendation for next-quarter marketing strategy.

# Key Insights I Found

Campaign Type A generated stronger new customer revenue than Campaign Type B.

Email was the top-performing channel overall.

Instagram and Web Banner supported reach for new customers, but contributed less revenue.

New customer distribution was fairly balanced across channels, supporting multi-touch strategy.

# My Recommendation

I recommended focusing on Campaign Type A through the Email channel next quarter. Personalization, smarter timing, and A/B testing could help improve conversion even further. I also suggested maintaining Instagram support to reach new audiences.
